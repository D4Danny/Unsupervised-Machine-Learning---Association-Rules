# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning---Association-Rules
Association rule learning is a type of unsupervised learning technique that checks for the dependency of one data item on another data item and maps accordingly so that it can be more profitable. It tries to find some interesting relations or associations among the variables of dataset. It is based on different rules to discover the interesting relations between variables in the database.

An association rule has 2 parts:

an antecedent (if) and
a consequent (then)
An antecedent is something thatâ€™s found in data, and a consequent is an item that is found in combination with the antecedent. 

Prepare rules for the all the data sets 
1) Try different values of support and confidence. Observe the change in number of rules for different support,confidence values
2) Change the minimum length in apriori algorithm
3) Visulize the obtained rules using different plots 

### Dataset 1: [Books Store](https://github.com/D4Danny/Association-Rule-Mining/blob/main/Association%20Rules%20for%20BOOKS.ipynb)

Please find the antecedent and consequent from the different Category of book sold by a book store.

### Dataset 2: [MY_MOVIE](https://github.com/D4Danny/Association-Rule-Mining/blob/main/Association%20Rules%20for%20MY%20MOVIES.ipynb)

Please find the antecedent and consequent from the different Category of Movies sold together by a firm.
